              <h3>Wooden Agricultural Fencing</h3>
              <p>Dollar Fence offers a variety of wooden fencing solutions for agricultural applications. Every wooden ranch rail fence we build uses only premium-grade materials and expert craftsmanship. We construct our agricultural wood fences using pressure-treated pine for exceptional durability. This lumber is protected by warranties against rot and termite damage, giving you peace of mind for years to come.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="agricultural-option-card">
              <h3>3 & 4 Board Ranch Rail Fence</h3>
              <p>Our 3-rail and 4-rail wood fences are a classic choice among farmers and ranchers. These fences are widely seen across rural properties and remain the standard for the iconic "Kentucky-style" farm fence look. Strong, reliable, and timeless.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="agricultural-option-card">
              <h3>Wood Horizontal Slat Agricultural Fence</h3>
              <p>For a sleeker profile, our horizontal slat fence offers a modern take on the classic ranch style. With more boards and smaller gaps than traditional 3- or 4-board fences, it creates a tighter, streamlined appearance. This option is popular among livestock owners and equestrian centres looking for a blend of safety and aesthetics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="agricultural-option-card">
              <h3>Iron Agricultural Fencing</h3>
              <p>For maximum longevity, our iron post-and-rail fencing is made from 100% powder-coated steel. It's the most durable low-maintenance agricultural fence available today. Rails are crafted from 18-gauge steel, posts from 16-gauge, offering 1,200 lbs. of vertical strength and 400 lbs. of horizontal force resistance—with 4 inches of flexibility for animal safety.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Low-Maintenance Vinyl Agricultural Fencing</h2>
          <p>In addition to traditional wood options, Dollar Fence also installs vinyl ranch rail fencing for a clean, low-maintenance solution. Vinyl fencing maintains clear visibility across your property line and is ideal for farms, stables, and livestock enclosures. Our standard vinyl ranch rail comes in a 3-rail setup but can be adjusted to a 2-rail configuration if needed.</p>

          <h2>What Type of Agricultural Fence Do You Need?</h2>
          <p>Do you need to contain livestock, protect crops, or defend against predators? The right farm fence depends on the size, strength, and behavior of your animals—as well as what you're trying to keep out. At Dollar Fence, we'll help you assess your land, livestock, and goals to recommend the best fencing solution for your property and budget.</p>

          <h2>Additional Agricultural Fencing Options</h2>
          <p>With any of our post-and-rail fencing styles, you can add welded metal wire to the interior for enhanced protection. This added barrier helps block deer, rabbits, and other wildlife from entering your land and damaging crops or gardens. It's an ideal enhancement for agricultural and horticultural fencing.</p>

          <h2>We Want to Be Your Agricultural and Livestock Fencing Partner</h2>
          <p>At Dollar Fence, every agricultural fence is built to outperform the rest—in both durability and design. If you're ready to secure your land, protect your animals, and upgrade your fencing system, contact us today to schedule your consultation.</p>

          <h2>Why Choose Dollar Fence for Agricultural Fencing?</h2>
          <p>As agricultural fencing specialists, Dollar Fence excels in custom farm and ranch fencing solutions. With over two decades of experience and multiple locations nationwide, we're among the most trusted names in agricultural fence construction across the country. Our experienced teams understand the unique demands of working farms, from livestock containment to crop protection.

          <h2>Premium Agricultural Fence Specifications</h2>
          <p>The Dollar Fence agricultural line was designed from the ground up to outperform the industry norm. Our agricultural fence specifications exceed standard requirements, engineered to withstand harsh weather conditions, livestock pressure, and daily farm operations. Along with these durable materials, our custom features bring added strength, longevity, and functionality to your property.</p>
          
          <p>Many fence providers use standard materials that may not hold up to the demanding conditions of agricultural environments. Over time, some manufacturers have cut costs by using thinner posts, lower-grade lumber, or inadequate protective treatments that fail under constant exposure to the elements and livestock.</p>
          
          <p>At Dollar Fence, we've installed millions of feet of agricultural fence, so we know what holds up and what doesn't. That's why we created our own custom agricultural specifications — to guarantee long-term consistency, strength, and value for working farms and ranches. While our fences may cost slightly more up front, we believe it's better to invest in quality once than to deal with fence failures and costly replacements again and again.</p>
