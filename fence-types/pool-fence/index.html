          <h2>Dollar Fence Pool Products</h2>
          <p>Dollar Fence operates across 100+ locations nationwide, providing expert fabrication and installation of high-quality pool fences tailored to the needs of each community, home, and family. If you're searching for a pool fence company that specialises in all fencing types, choose Dollar Fence. We'll help you design a secure, attractive, and durable pool fence that protects your pool and spa area for years to come. Fencing isn't just part of what we do — it's everything we do.</p>

          <h2>Dollar Fence is your most trusted and experienced pool fence company</h2>
          <p>Each year, approximately 300 children under the age of five drown in residential pools across the United States. It's a heartbreaking statistic that calls for action. At Dollar Fence, we design and install pool fences that not only fully enclose pool areas but also feature self-closing, self-latching gates for added protection. Our goal is to help secure your pool space and keep your loved ones safe. Did you know that many local authorities have their own specific safety rules for both above-ground and in-ground pools? These regulations are in place to protect not just your family, but also your neighbours. Young children can slip away in seconds — don't rely on inadequate fencing to keep them safe.</p>

          <h2>Choose the best pool fence company for your home</h2>
          <p>With a Dollar Fence pool fence, you can be confident that your installation meets all community safety requirements and local code standards. An effective pool fence must create a secure, permanent barrier that prevents children from gaining unsupervised access. Your pool fence should be difficult to climb, and designed to prevent any passage over, under, or through the structure.</p>

          </div>
          <h2>Dollar Fence delivers the safest pool fencing available</h2>
          <p>By law, pool fences must be at least 48 inches high. However, the code refers to the installed height — not just the panel height. Dollar Fence ensures your finished pool fence installation meets or exceeds this requirement. Our vinyl and aluminum pool fence panels are built taller than 48 inches so that, once installed, they fully comply with code. Dollar Fence pool fences are also designed without footholds or handholds. Vertical pickets are spaced no more than 4 inches apart, and horizontal rails are positioned at least 45 inches apart to prevent climbing. For wood pool fences, if the "good side" faces outward, we still position supports to meet the same spacing rule. The bottom of the fence remains within 4 inches of solid ground or 2 inches for soft surfaces like grass or gravel.</p>

          <h2>When it comes to pool fencing, experience matters</h2>
          <p>Choosing the right contractor is crucial when it comes to pool fencing. At Dollar Fence, we have years of specialised experience in fencing. We are one of the largest and most established pool fence companies in the Southeast. Your family's safety is our number one priority. We guarantee every Dollar Fence pool fence is designed, built, and installed to the highest safety and performance standards.</p>

          <h2>Pool fence options for every requirement</h2>
          <p>Our wood fences are built on-site using heavy-duty materials and meet Miami-Dade wind load standards. They're fastened with corrosion-resistant, galvanized steel hardware for longevity. We also offer aluminium pool fences in powder-coated finishes that meet all local safety codes and community regulations. Our pool fences are customisable in height and spacing for additional security. Whether you need 48 inches or more, Dollar Fence builds pool fences that are secure, attractive, and made to last.</p>

          <h2>Pool fence financing made simple</h2>
          <p>A pool fence is an essential safety feature—not a luxury. At Dollar Fence, we make it easier to protect your family right away with flexible pool fence financing. We understand that the cost of a fence may be unexpected, and we're here to help. With partnerships across 13 lending providers, we can offer financing options even for those with credit scores as low as 500. Don't delay—secure your pool now with a payment plan that works for you.</p>

          <h2>Pool fence installation you can count on</h2>
          <p>You could buy prefabricated panels from a chain store and attempt to install your own fence—but doing so may compromise your family's safety. Mass-produced fencing and unprofessional installation often result in poor security and short-lived materials. With professional pool fence installation from Dollar Fence, you get a custom-built, high-quality fence that is installed the right way. We've installed millions of feet of fence across the country, and we bring that experience to every project.</p>
