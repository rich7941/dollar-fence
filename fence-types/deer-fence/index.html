          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Deer Fencing</h2>
          <div class="care-tips">
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>How does deer fencing work?</h3>
              <p>Deer fencing provides a physical barrier to prevent deer from entering your yard, garden, or property. Our fences are designed to be eco-friendly and humane—effectively deterring deer without harming wildlife.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>What height is best for deer fencing?</h3>
              <p>We recommend a fence height of 7 to 8 feet. In open grassy areas, 7 feet is often sufficient, while wooded or landscaped spaces typically require 8 feet to prevent deer from jumping over.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>What color deer fence works best?</h3>
              <p>We suggest neutral tones like black or brown for the most discreet appearance. Black PVC-coated mesh and metal fencing are popular due to their strength and ability to blend into natural surroundings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Can deer crawl under fences?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Deer can wiggle under fences if there are gaps as small as 6 inches. They may even use their noses to push up the bottom edge if it's not properly secured.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>How do you prevent deer from going under the fence?</h3>
              <p>We secure the bottom of every deer fence by burying the base a few inches below ground and filling low spots with gravel or rocks. For extra protection, we use mesh fencing that extends close to the ground with minimal clearance. Regular maintenance ensures long-term effectiveness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>What's the safest fence option for deer?</h3>
              <p>Our deer fencing systems are wildlife-friendly and designed to protect your property without harming deer or disrupting the ecosystem. It's a humane way to create boundaries while preserving your local environment.</p>
