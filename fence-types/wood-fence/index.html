          <h2>Wood Fence - America's Most Popular Choice</h2>
          <p>Wood fence remains the most popular type of fence across the country, and Dollar Fence is your trusted wood fence company. Wood fence is budget-friendly, provides great privacy, and features a timeless natural appearance that enhances landscaping and blends beautifully with garden elements.</p>
          
          <div class="image-container">

          </div>

          <h2>Premium Wood Fence Lumber</h2>
          <p>We use premium pressure treated pine lumber to construct your wood fence. At Dollar Fence, we select top-grade lumber because it's backed by a strong manufacturer's warranty. Our fence pickets come with a minimum fifteen-year warranty covering termite damage and rot. Posts and horizontal rails are protected by a lifetime warranty against both rot and termites. When you choose a wood fence from us, you're getting durability built in.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Wood Fence Specifications</h2>
          <p>At Dollar Fence, we use reinforced lumber to craft your wood fence. Our building standards are based on specifications inspired by the Miami-Dade wind code. This means your wood fence is constructed to withstand some of the toughest weather conditions. The primary variation is that we space our posts every eight feet instead of four—unless a different layout is requested.</p>

          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/assets/images/hardwood-boundary-fence.jpg" alt="Hardwood Boundary Fence Construction" class="content-image">
          </div>

          <h2>Custom Construction Process</h2>
          <p>Every wood fence we install is custom built on-site. Each post is anchored in concrete to prevent movement over time. We secure each board individually with hot-dipped galvanized ring shank nails that resist rust and separation. Unlike pre-assembled panels, this hands-on approach creates a sturdier structure. A Dollar Fence wood fence is engineered for long-term performance.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Wood Fence Styles</h2>
          <p>Board-on-board wood fencing delivers full privacy by overlapping boards, while stockade wood fencing uses side-by-side boards for a simpler privacy layout. Shadowbox wood fencing allows airflow and partial visibility when viewed at an angle, offering less resistance to wind. For this reason, many neighborhoods in Broward County require residents to install shadowbox wood fencing rather than total privacy styles.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Maintenance and Care</h2>
          <p>While wood fencing may not match the longevity of vinyl or aluminum options, proper upkeep can extend its life. Applying a stain and sealant gives your wood fence added protection from sunlight, rain, and fluctuating temperatures.</p>

          <div class="care-tips">
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Sealing and Staining</h3>
              <p>Apply a protective coat of sealant, stain, or paint within 30 days to 6 weeks of installation. Wait 4 to 6 weeks to allow the wood to adjust naturally to sunlight and weather changes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Cleaning</h3>
              <p>Use a gentle wash with a low-pressure washer to remove dirt, mold, and debris. Use mild cleaner made for pressure-treated wood and avoid high-pressure settings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Inspection</h3>
              <p>Periodically inspect your wood fence for signs of wear in both the boards and fasteners to ensure continued stability and performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Natural Wood Behavior</h3>
              <p>Wood may shrink, split, bow, or twist over time. Treated wood starts with a greenish tone but gradually fades to brown or grey as it weathers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Wood Fence Warranty</h2>
          <p>When you choose a Dollar Fence wood fence made from pressure-treated pine, you're investing in strength and long-lasting beauty. The pressure treatment process protects against rot, fungus, and termite activity. Your wood fence comes with a 15-year minimum warranty for pickets, and lifetime coverage for both posts and horizontal rails to guard against those potential issues.</p>
