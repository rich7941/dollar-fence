          <h2>Dollar Fence Vinyl Products</h2>
          <p>Dollar Fence vinyl products are built with innovation in mind. With standout features like PrivacyGuard, WeatherSeal, StrongMan, and CountryWood, you're getting more than a fence — you're getting the best. Our fence profiles are engineered for superior strength and backed by a lifetime transferable warranty. You'll get a top-tier fence and, most importantly, peace of mind.</p>

          <h2>Dollar Fence Innovations</h2>
          <p>Our unique Dollar Fence innovations were created with you in mind. While Dollar Fence proudly stands behind every fence we install, we understand how frustrating it can be to deal with unexpected fence repairs. That's why we've developed a line of powerful enhancements designed to improve product performance and reduce warranty issues. These upgrades have drastically cut down on service calls and given our customers lasting peace of mind.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Why Choose a Dollar Fence Vinyl Fence?</h2>
          <p>As vinyl fabrication experts, Dollar Fence specialises in custom vinyl fencing and railing. With over two decades of experience and multiple manufacturing locations, we're among the most trusted names in vinyl fence construction across the country. Our local teams operate CNC precision routers at every facility, enabling us to cut and create any custom vinyl fence design you can imagine. Our commitment to quality means we're one of the few companies equipped to build fences rated for high-wind zones like Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties.</p>

          <h2>Premium Dollar Fence Specifications</h2>
          <p>The Dollar Fence line was designed from the ground up to outperform the industry norm. Our vinyl material specification exceeds standard requirements, engineered to resist powerful winds and UV exposure alike. Along with these tough materials, our custom features bring added strength, fade resistance, and curb appeal.</p>

          </div>
          
          <p>Many fence providers purchase their vinyl from third-party sources. Over time, some manufacturers have cut costs by thinning vinyl panels or reducing protective elements in the capstock — the critical top layer exposed to the sun.</p>
          
          <p>At Dollar Fence, we've installed millions of feet of vinyl fence, so we know what holds up and what doesn't. That's why we created our own custom vinyl spec — to guarantee long-term consistency, strength, and value. While our fences may cost slightly more up front, we believe it's better to justify quality once than to deal with poor results again and again.</p>

          <h2>Vinyl Fence Care</h2>
          <div class="care-tips">
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Installation Guidelines</h3>
              <p>Be sure to follow correct installation guidelines. Avoid exposing your vinyl fence to unusual or high heat sources like fire pits, BBQ grills, or reflective surfaces such as windows and glass doors. Also avoid placing vinyl fencing next to heat-retaining materials like asphalt, concrete, or dark-colored gravel.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Heat Management</h3>
              <p>Darker finishes—like Golden Oak or Red Chestnut—can become warm to the touch under long-term sunlight exposure. To help reduce heat buildup, consider using awnings, umbrellas, or similar shading solutions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Cleaning</h3>
              <p>To clean off dust or dirt, simply use mild soap and water. Always test any cleaner in a small, hidden section first to ensure it doesn't affect the vinyl fence's appearance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Important Warnings</h3>
              <p>Do NOT paint your vinyl fencing. Products like spray-on sunscreen or insect repellent may stain the surface if sprayed directly on or near the vinyl. Apply these products indoors, away from your fence and railing, or take care to avoid overspray. Avoid placing rubber mats directly on vinyl surfaces, as they can lead to discoloration over time.</p>

            <h3>PrivacyGuard Vinyl Fence</h3>
            <p>Unlike standard tongue-and-groove styles, our exclusive PrivacyGuard system secures each vinyl panel with a locking connection. This design prevents wind from passing through and significantly lowers the risk of fence damage compared to traditional vinyl fence styles. With PrivacyGuard, your fence provides reliable security.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="features-card">
            <h3>WeatherSeal UV Protection</h3>
            <p>The sun's harsh rays can fade and discolor ordinary vinyl fences over time. That's why every Dollar Fence vinyl fence includes WeatherSeal — a proprietary acrylic blend designed to block UV exposure. WeatherSeal acts as a durable outer layer, reducing oxidation and maintaining your fence's original finish even in tough climates. With WeatherSeal, your fence gets advanced sun protection.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="features-card">
            <h3>StrongMan Reinforced Rails</h3>
            <p>Our StrongMan rail system includes grooves that are 32% deeper than standard rails, allowing pickets to embed more securely. This structural advantage improves wind resistance and overall durability. With StrongMan, your vinyl fence delivers unmatched strength in all conditions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="features-card">
            <h3>CountryWood: Real Wood Look, No Wood Worries</h3>
            <p>CountryWood by Dollar Fence combines the beauty of natural wood with the resilience of vinyl. Available in two rich tones — Golden Oak and Red Chestnut — these fences replicate the look of aged timber without the hassle of splinters, rot, or refinishing. With CountryWood, you enjoy the charm of wood with zero upkeep.</p>
