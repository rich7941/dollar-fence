          <h2>Premium Trex Composite Fencing</h2>
          <p>Trex fencing is the premium privacy fence alternative to traditional wood and vinyl. Dollar Fence offers one of the widest selections of fencing options for your backyard—from natural wood and sleek aluminum to low-maintenance vinyl and upscale Trex composite fencing. Whatever your style or purpose, we have the right fence for you.</p>
          
          <p>Trex Fence is a one-of-a-kind product that blends the warm appearance of wood with the durability and low maintenance of vinyl. Its interlocking board-on-board design creates a full-privacy fence that's visually distinct and structurally sound. This system gives you maximum security, superior wind resistance, and a modern aesthetic that sets your property apart.</p>

          <h2>Trex Fence Systems</h2>
          <p>Since launching in 2005, Trex has become the go-to choice for homeowners seeking a private outdoor space framed by a stylish and maintenance-free fence. Built by the world's top manufacturer of outdoor living materials, Trex fences deliver beauty and durability in one seamless system.</p>
          
          <p>Every fence starts with strength—and Trex posts are made of dense wood-plastic composite (WPC) with thick walls capable of standing up to high winds. Posts are anchored into concrete footings and typically require no additional reinforcement (except for gates or extra-tall fences). With height options exceeding 6 feet, we also offer 12-foot posts to ensure deep, secure installations.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of a Trex Fence</h2>
          <p>Trex fencing delivers exceptional benefits that set it apart from traditional fencing materials. With complete privacy design, neighbor-friendly appearance, and superior durability, Trex fences offer the perfect combination of functionality and aesthetics. Built to last with eco-friendly materials and backed by a lifetime warranty, Trex fencing provides low-maintenance outdoor living solutions.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Expert Design and Construction</h2>
          <p>Trex's design goes beyond function—it's crafted with detail in every component. While most fences are built solely for privacy or security, Trex fences also focus on style. The aluminum-reinforced bottom rail is clad with composite boards, while the interlocking pickets fit securely into side channels. The T-shaped top rail provides a clean, polished cap with shadow-line depth, and decorative post caps complete the finished look.</p>

          <h2>Trex Fence Care</h2>
          <div class="care-tips">
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Installation Guidelines</h3>
              <p>Follow proper installation guidelines. Avoid placing your Trex fence near high heat sources such as fire pits, grills, or glass reflections.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Heat Management</h3>
              <p>Darker Trex colors like Golden Oak or Red Chestnut may warm up in direct sun—use awnings or shade structures to mitigate heat retention.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Cleaning</h3>
              <p>Clean dirt with mild soap and water. Always test cleaning agents on a hidden section before full application.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="care-tip">
              <h3>Important Warnings</h3>
              <p>Do not paint Trex fencing. Products like bug spray or sunscreen can cause discoloration if sprayed directly. Apply these away from the fence. Avoid rubber mats near the base, as they may cause surface discoloration.</p>
