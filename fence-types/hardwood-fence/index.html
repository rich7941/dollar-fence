          <h2>Premium Hardwood Fence with Decorative Lattice Top</h2>
          <p>If you're looking to blend timeless elegance with complete outdoor privacy, the premium privacy wood fence from Dollar Fence is the perfect solution. Featuring vertical tongue-and-groove boards and a decorative lattice-style top rail, this fence offers both security and sophistication. Whether you want to shield your backyard from neighbours, define property boundaries, or elevate the look of your landscape, this wood privacy fence delivers unmatched durability, visual appeal, and long-term value.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>A Modern Take on Traditional Privacy Fencing</h2>
          <p>Our premium wood privacy fences are designed to meet the needs of homeowners who want more than just a plain boundary line. The classic vertical board-on-board design provides full coverage, eliminating any visible gaps between panels. At the top, a decorative lattice adds an architectural accent that softens the overall appearance and allows just the right amount of airflow and light. This combination makes the fence a popular choice for upscale homes, garden enclosures, and poolside perimeters.</p>
          
          <p>Crafted with clean, contemporary lines and warm natural tones, this fence adds a refined look to any setting. The square post caps and bold trim details give it a substantial feel, while the seamless construction ensures a smooth finish from end to end. This style is ideal for homeowners who want a premium appearance without sacrificing privacy or security.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Built from Premium Hardwood or Cedar</h2>
          <p>Dollar Fence hardwood fences are constructed using high-quality pressure-treated hardwood or Western Red Cedar materials, naturally resistant to decay, insect damage, and warping. Our premium materials combined with weather-resistant coatings and structural support ensure your hardwood fence delivers complete privacy, custom finishes, and long-lasting value for your property.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Functional Privacy Without Sacrificing Style</h2>
          <p>The primary goal of any privacy fence is to protect your property and create a secluded environment. With its tall panels and solid construction, this fence offers a complete visual barrier from neighbouring properties, busy roads, or adjacent buildings. The tight vertical alignment of the boards prevents gaps and prevents peeking through, making it ideal for pool areas, patios, or family backyards where comfort and discretion matter most.</p>
          
          <p>Despite its strength, the fence maintains a warm, inviting appearance thanks to its rich wood tones and decorative lattice top. It adds structure and elegance without making your space feel closed off or harsh. Whether you're relaxing on the patio, hosting friends outdoors, or creating a serene backyard sanctuary, this fence enhances the experience.</p>

          <h2>Custom Sizes, Finishes, and Installation Options</h2>
          <p>Dollar Fence offers custom sizing and layout options to ensure your new privacy fence fits your yard perfectly. Choose from standard heights such as 6 ft or 8 ft, or request a custom build to accommodate sloped terrain or specific HOA requirements. The decorative top can be finished in various patterns including square lattice, diagonal lattice, or solid cap rails for a more minimal look.</p>
          
          <p>We also offer stain and sealing services to preserve your wood fence's rich tone and increase its longevity. Whether you prefer a clear sealant that lets the grain show through or a darker finish to match your home's exterior, our team will help you choose the best option for both appearance and protection.</p>
