        <p class="mb-3">A fence is only as secure as its gate. Dollar Fence installs reliable access systems and perimeter security to safeguard homes, businesses, and commercial properties. Whether you need a custom gate for your driveway or full perimeter control for a larger site, we'll help create an affordable, secure solution that gives you 24/7 peace of mind.</p>
